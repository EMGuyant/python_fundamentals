# Cube Class
The `cube_class.py` file was created while exploring python functions and classes. This is done by defining the cube class, creating a `main()` function that creates two cubes, and creating a funtion `writeCube(c)` to print various measurements of the cube.

## Contents of `cube_class.py`
* class Cube
  * Creates a cube with a specificed side length and provides various calculations of cube features including the volumne, surface area, face diagonal, and space diagonal
* function writeCube(c)
  * A function that takes a cube as an argument and prints its information.
* function main()
  * A function that tests the cube class.
    * Constructs a cube with a side length of 5.3 and 3.1 then calls the `writeCube` function on each to print out each cubes measurements.
