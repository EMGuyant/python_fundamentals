# Basic Statistics Module
A module that implement basic statistics functions including the mean, standard deviation, median, geometric mean, harmonic mean, inner product for a list of numbers provided in the command line by the user.

The program implements a sentinel loop to get the list of numbers provided by the user and a list of methods including `mean(nums)`, `stdDev(nums, xbar)`, `median(nums)`, `geometricMean(nums)`, `harmonicMean(nums)`, and `innerProduct(nums1, nums2)` to print the corresponding measure.
